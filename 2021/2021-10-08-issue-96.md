### Django Fellow Reports

<p>Carlton Gibson, one of two Django Fellows, has moved his Fellow Reports to his website. These are excellent ways to catch up on Django's development quickly.</p>

<p>The Fellows, Carlton and Mariusz Felisiak, are contracted by the Django Software Foundation to work on Django and do the day-to-day running of the framework. They handle ticket triage, pull request review, security reports, releases, community management, and so on. These are the kind of tasks that wouldn't get done on a project the size of Django otherwise.</p>

<p>Django has managed monthly security/bugfix releases and major releases every eight to nine months, thanks to the Fellows.</p>
