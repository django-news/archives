## News

### Wagtail 2.8 is released!

<p>In case you missed it, Wagtail 2.8 was released and adds Django 3.0 support while dropping Django 2.0 support plus a bunch of new features and bugfixes.</p>

### ðŸš¨ Docker/Postgres now requires a username & password

<p>In the latest version of Docker, Postgres now requires either a username &amp; password to be set, or use another setting to allow non-pw access. <em>This affects all Postgres versions for Docker.</em></p>

<p>This is better for security, but frustrating that Docker made such a major change in this quiet way. It breaks many existing builds.</p>

<p>The authors of Two Scoops of Django have released their latest book, the Django Crash Course.  Based on their corporate training, they are offering the book for under US$20, which is a steal considering they normally charge $3000/person for in-person training. This book, currently 50 chapters long, is intended for passionate learners willing to get the latest, most cutting-edge written materials. Still in alpha, the book is being updated several days a week, with at least five more chapters to go before completion.</p>

<p>Available in E-Book format, the paperback, coil-bound, and hardcover versions are available for pre-order.</p>
