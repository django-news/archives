  ## Updates to Django

  ### Updates to Django

  <p>From Django Review and Triage Team Member <a href="https://cur.at/YO5BSXm">Sarah Boyce</a>...</p>

<p>Last week we had <a href="https://cur.at/D6LdGgq">10 pull requests</a> merged into Django by 8 different contributors - including 1 first time contributor!
Congratulations to <a href="https://cur.at/EgGssf2">Yaser Amiri</a> for having their first commit merged into Django - welcome on board!</p>

<p>Now, from Django 5.0, <a href="https://cur.at/7oWyICK">@sensitive_variables and @sensitive_post_parameters</a> supports async functions!</p>

<p>Are you excited to contribute but not know where to start? Maybe you're interested in migrations? You could add logging of applied/unapplied migrations <a href="https://cur.at/ibFgQFg">#24800</a>
and then you'd be perfect to add contributor documentation for django.db.migrations <a href="https://cur.at/n5aQkrO">#24989</a>!
Look forward to welcoming you on board!</p>
