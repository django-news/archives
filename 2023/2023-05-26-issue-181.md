  ## Updates to Django

  ### Django PRs May 14th - 22nd

  <p>We're trying out a new category, curated by <a href="https://cur.at/E0hJZlz">Sarah Boyce</a>, highlighting contributions to the Django codebase.</p>

<p>On the week starting May 15th, we had <a href="https://cur.at/HIlS13S">10 pull requests</a> merged into Django by 8 different contributors - including 3 first time contributors!
Congratulations to <a href="https://cur.at/GSah9d5">Julie Rymer</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/m6e2btt">Dingning</a> and <a href="https://cur.at/z4yhJPy">Rajeesh Punathil</a> for having their first commits merged into Django - welcome onboard!</p>

<p>We saw a number of updates including adding (into Django 5.0) async support to checking user passwords (<a href="https://cur.at/Om0HXGv">#16855</a>) and xframe_options_deny, xframe_options_sameorigin, xframe_options_exempt decorators (<a href="https://cur.at/fo6zTk1">#16800</a>). It's great to see Django's async story continue to grow!</p>

<p>Want to leave your mark on the framework but struggling to chose a ticket? Here are a couple you might find interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bug <a href="https://cur.at/IVDzs4w">#17235</a> - Multipartparser shouldn't leave request.POST/request.FILES mutable.</li>
<li>Documentation <a href="https://cur.at/nubqgxY">#33682</a> - Clarify using distinct() with related fields that have Meta.ordering defined.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please read through the <a href="https://cur.at/qHczHJd">contributing guide</a> and if you need any help you can reach out on the <a href="https://cur.at/TyE0oRb">Django forum</a> or the <a href="https://cur.at/hgdCjgT">Django Discord</a>. We'd love to welcome you onboard!</p>
